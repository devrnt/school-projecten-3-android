# School Project 3 - Talentcoach - Android

Our second school project was seperated in a backend, frontend and a mobile application part. The Android application was made with `Kotlin`.
This project was our final project and was very advanced. We had to keep contact with our customer by ourself.

In Belgium we have a school platform called `Smartschool` in the Flanders, this platform is used by teachers to publish their school grades, upload tasks, keep in touch by email...

This project was to create an alternative for Smartschool, it was more focused on giving ratings and set a capability to 'accomplished'.

This repo contains all the code that was used for the Android application.
